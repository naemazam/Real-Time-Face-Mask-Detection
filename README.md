# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection
Real-Time Face Mask Detection OpenCV Python – During the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO mandated the use of masks to guard against the deadly virus. With regards to the mandate, we came up with a machine learning project called Real-Time Face Mask Detection was developed using Python OpenCV and Keras.

We used Python, Keras, and OpenCV to create a deep learning model for face mask identification in this project. The face mask detector model was created to determine whether or not a person is wearing a mask. We used Keras with network architecture to train the model.


# Importance of Real-Time Face Mask Detection Python

When talking, breathing, or coughing, face coverings reduce the volume and travel distance of exhaled droplets. A face mask with no vents or holes will filter out virus-carrying particles from inhaled and exhaled air, lowering the risk of infection. 

# Major Functionalities

Display Real-Time Camera – For this functionality the system will display a real-time camera.
Detecting Faces – For this functionality the real-time camera detect faces.
Detecting Wearing Mask or Not – For this functionality the system detects if the person wearing face mask or not.
